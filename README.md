# MyBatchProcessor
Simple batch processor for demonstration purposes.

For this to work with SOLIDWORKS you must have a SOLIDWORKS Document Manager License Key. This can be obtained from SOLIDWORKS at this [url](http://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/api-support.htm).

Once you have your license key, update the class `SolidWorksDocMgr.cs` by replacing the value of licenseKey with your specified license key. For each new release of SOLIDWORKS you must obtain an updated license key for it to continue to work.
